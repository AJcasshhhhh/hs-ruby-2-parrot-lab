# Boring Parrot - write a method for a normal parrot that squawks back whatever string you give him as an argument




# Friendly Parrot - this parrot greets people by saying their name and age (don't forget to pass that information in as arguments).




# Favorites Parrot - tell this parrot about your three favorite things and he will tell you how much he agrees with you.




# Math Parrot - this parrot does math! (addition, subtraction, multiplication - it's up to you)




# Now try calling your methods below.




# Now let's pretend you are a wizard and you want to place a spell on each parrots so that it speaks backwards. How would you do that?




# The spell has been broken and everyone is speaking normally again. The parrots are really excited about it though - make them all shout.
