![parrot](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a8_a0QWEYxs/UKjDiHLo5zI/AAAAAAAADNo/0VJ2Tm7FYA0/s1600/funny+d.jpg)

In this lab you'll be training some parrots with special talents. Fork and clone this lab and follow along and write your code in the parrot.rb file. Try running your program when you are done. (Hint - You'll be chaining methods, pay attention to your return values!)
